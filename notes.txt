# Initialization (Setup)
1. Create a random population of N elements with random DNA / genetic material

# Forever loop (Draw)
2. SELECTION - Evaluate fitness of each element of the population 
(fitness in relation to an ideal target if known) 
build a "mating pool" (larger)

3. Reproduction
    a. SELECT -- two parents with probability according to relative fitness
    b. CROSSOVER -- create a child - mix/combine DNA of parents
    c. MUTATION -- mutate the childs DNA based on a given probability
    d. Add the new child to a NEW population

4. Replace the old population with the new population and return to Step 2.
(evolution cycles)


Key Principles:
- Fitness
- Heredity/Reproduction ("2 or 2+ parents" in the population "reproduce" and add a "child" with mixed elements of both parents)
- Variation
- Selection (Determine fitness)
