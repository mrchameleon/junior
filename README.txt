# Junior -- Evolutionary creative coding focusing on a character based design 

## Background - Who is Junior?

Junior is a character that I have come up with who has evolved over time in my artistic process.
I have drawn and/or painted Junior thousands of times manually. 
Every junior is slightly different than the last, but the overall look is consistent with the themes below

-- Junior should never be exactly the same as the last Junior
-- Junior has a head, a neck, and a body.
-- Junior has two arms and two legs (generally)
-- Junior has minimalistic facial features. Usually a triangle. Sometimes a smile.
-- Junior sometimes has the symbol of a heart on the body/chest area.
-- Juniors arms and legs are wavy lines
-- Juniors neck is a short-ish arc connecting the body to the head
-- Juniors are generally dancing or wavy
-- Juniors contours are generally long and flowing, smooth. (but may not be when agitated)
-- Junior can sometimes be agitated with energy or lightning like eminations
-- Junior is sometimes a stick figure style construction
-- Junior is sometimes a closed loop style construction (think a polygon or freeform shape that could be filled with a paint bucket tool.)

## Roughly Prioritized Ideas/Goals

(Using p5.js)

[ ] generate a Junior in its most primitive construction. (stick figure)
[ ] generate a closed-loop style Junior that closely matches a hand-drawn junior
[ ] allow basic options and settings for having many variations on the way the junior gets constructed (UI-sliders?, Size, Color, Type, Wiggliness, etc)

[ ] Incorporate code from my "random painter" p5js sketch to animate/draw the junior with a continuous line

[ ] Optimize construction to be organized and readable code that draws each step in an isolated way. (eg: body method,  head method.)

[ ] Incorporate efficient ways to arrive at a correctly formatted junior. (Bezier curves? Perlin Noise?)
[ ] Incorporate alternate style options for features  (ie: Limb wiggliness, outline jagged/smooth, stylistic effects?)

[ ] design an evolving algorithm that will provide new inputs for the draw method to evolve juniors that can morph rapidly into more interesting/varied or "fit" designs
[ ] make the algorithm more sophisticated and configurable in its simulation of evolving juniors
[ ] provide variable based or UI options to choose from various color schemes
[ ] provide UI options to overlay junior on various interesting/artistic backgrounds 


[ ] users can select the most "fit" junior in a set of outputs, to instruct the program to generate a new set from that "Gene".

[ ] Incorporate animation, dynamic wiggles, or user control via mouse
[ ] export still images and/or animations as gif/video?
